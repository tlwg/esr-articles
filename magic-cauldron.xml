<abstract>
<para>This essay analyzes the evolving economic substrate of the open-source
phenomenon.  I first explode some prevalent myths about the funding of
program development and the price structure of software.  I then
present a game-theory analysis of the stability of open-source
cooperation.  I present nine models for sustainable funding of
open-source development; two non-profit, seven for-profit.  I then
continue to develop a qualitative theory of when it is economically
rational for software to be closed.  I then examine some novel
additional mechanisms the market is now inventing to fund for-profit
open-source development, including the reinvention of the patronage
system and task markets.  I conclude with some tentative predictions
of the future.</para>

<sect1><title>Indistinguishable From Magic</title>

<para>In Welsh myth, the goddess Ceridwen owned a great cauldron that
would magically produce nourishing food&mdash;when commanded by a spell
known only to the goddess.  In modern science, Buckminster Fuller gave
us the concept of `ephemeralization', technology becoming both more
effective and less expensive as the physical resources invested in
early designs are replaced by more and more information content.
Arthur C. Clarke connected the two by observing that ``Any
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
magic''.</para>

<para>To many people, the successes of the open-source community seem
like an implausible form of magic.  High-quality software materializes
``for free'', which is nice while it lasts but hardly seems
sustainable in the real world of competition and scarce resources.
What's the catch?  Is Ceridwen's cauldron just a conjuring trick?  And
if not, how does ephemeralization work in this context&mdash;what spell
is the goddess speaking?</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Beyond Geeks Bearing Gifts</title>

<para>The experience of the open-source culture has certainly
confounded many of the assumptions of people who learned about
software development outside it.  <citetitle>The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</citetitle> <link linkend="CatB">[CatB]</link> described the
ways in which decentralized cooperative software development
effectively overturns Brooks's Law, leading to unprecedented levels of
reliability and quality on individual projects.
<citetitle>Homesteading the Noosphere</citetitle> <link
linkend="HtN">[HtN]</link> examined the social dynamics within which
this `bazaar' style of development is situated, arguing that it is
most effectively understood not in conventional exchange-economy terms
but as what anthropologists call a `gift culture' in which members
compete for status by giving things away.  In this essay I begin by
exploding some common myths about software production economics; then
continue the line of analysis of these essays into the realm of
economics, game theory and business models, developing new conceptual
tools needed to understand the way that the gift culture of
open-source developers can sustain itself in an exchange
economy.</para>

<para>In order to pursue this line of analysis without distraction,
we'll need to abandon (or at least agree to temporarily ignore) the
`gift culture' level of explanation. <citetitle>Homesteading the
Noosphere</citetitle> <link linkend="HtN">[HtN]</link> posited that
gift culture behavior arises in situations where survival goods are
abundant enough to make the exchange game no longer very interesting;
but while this appears sufficiently powerful as a
<emphasis>psychological</emphasis> explanation of behavior, it lacks
suffiency as an explanation of the mixed <emphasis>economic</emphasis>
context in which most open-source developers actually operate.  For
most, the exchange game has lost its appeal but not its power to
constrain.  Their behavior has to make sufficient
material-scarcity&ndash;economics sense to keep them in a
gift-culture&ndash;supporting zone of surplus.</para>

<para>Therefore, this essay will consider (from entirely
<emphasis>within</emphasis> the realm of scarcity economics) the modes
of cooperation and exchange that sustain open-source development.
While doing so it will answer the pragmatic question ``How do I make
money at this?'', in detail and with examples.  First, though, I will
show that much of the tension behind that question derives from
prevailing folk models of software-production economics that are false
to fact.</para>

<para>(A final note before the exposition: the discussion and advocacy
of open-source development in this essay should not be construed as a
case that closed-source development is intrinsically wrong, nor as a
brief against intellectual-property rights in software, nor as an
altruistic appeal to `share'.  While these arguments are still beloved
of a vocal minority in the open-source development community,
experience since <citetitle>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</citetitle>
was published has made it clear that they are unnecessary.  An
entirely sufficient case for open-source development rests on its
engineering and economic outcomes&mdash;better quality, higher
reliability, lower costs, and increased choice.)</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>The Manufacturing Delusion</title>

<para>We need to begin by noticing that computer programs like all
other kinds of tools or capital goods, have two distinct kinds of
economic value.  They have <firstterm>use value</firstterm> and
<firstterm>sale value</firstterm>.</para>

<para>The use value of a program is its economic value as a tool, a
productivity multiplier.  The sale value of a program is its value as
a salable commodity.  (In professional economist-speak, sale value is
value as a final good, and use value is value as an intermediate
good.)</para>

<para>When most people try to reason about software-production
economics, they tend to assume a `factory model' which is founded on
the following fundamental premises:</para>

<para>1. Most developer time is paid for by sale value.</para>

<para>2. The sale value of software is proportional to its development cost
(i.e., the cost of the resources required to functionally replicate it)
and to its use value.</para>

<para>In other words, people have a strong tendency to assume that software
has the value characteristics of a typical manufactured good.  But
both of these assumptions are demonstrably false.</para>

<para>First, code written for sale is only the tip of the programming
iceberg.  In the pre-microcomputer era it used to be a commonplace
that 90% of all the code in the world was written in-house at banks
and insurance companies.  This is probably no longer the
case&mdash;other industries are much more software-intensive now, and
the finance industry's share of the total must have accordingly
dropped&mdash;but we'll see shortly that there is empirical evidence
that approximately 95% of code is still written in-house.</para>

<para>This code includes most of the stuff of MIS, the financial- and
database-software customizations every medium and large company needs.
It includes technical-specialist code like device drivers. Almost
nobody makes money selling device drivers, a point we'll return to
later.  It includes all kinds of embedded code for our increasingly
microchip-driven machines - from machine tools and jet airliners to
cars to microwave ovens and toasters.</para>

<para>Most such in-house code is integrated with its environment in
ways that make reusing or copying it very difficult.  (This is true
whether the environment is a business office's set of procedures or
the fuel-injection system of a combine harvester.)  Thus, as the
environment changes, work is continually needed to keep the software
in step.</para>

<para>This is called `maintenance', and any software engineer or
systems analyst will tell you that it makes up the vast majority (more
than 75%) of what programmers get paid to do. Accordingly, most
programmer-hours are spent (and most programmer salaries are paid for)
writing or maintaining in-house code that has no sale value at
all&mdash;a fact the reader may readily check by examining the
listings of programming jobs in any newspaper with a `Help Wanted'
section.</para>

<para>Scanning the employment section of your local newspaper is an
enlightening experiment that I urge the reader to perform for him- or
herself.  Examine the jobs listings under programming, data
processing, and software engineering for positions that involve the
development of software. Categorize each such job according to whether
the software is being developed for use or for sale.</para>

<para>It will quickly become clear that, even given the most inclusive
definition of `for sale', at least 19 in 20 of the salaries offered
are being funded strictly by use value (that is, value as an
intermediate good).  This is our reason for believing that only 5% of
the industry is sale-value-driven.  Note, however, that the rest of
the analysis in this essay is relatively insensitive to this number;
if it were 15% or even 20%, the economic consequences would remain
essentially the same.</para>

<para>When I speak at technical conferences, I usually begin my talk
by asking two questions: how many in the audience are paid to write
software, and for how many do their salaries depend on the sale value
of software.  I generally get a forest of hands for the first
question, few or none for the second, and considerable audience
surprise at the proportion.</para>

<para>Second, the theory that the sale value of software is coupled to
its development or replacement costs is even more easily demolished by
examining the actual behavior of consumers.  There are many goods for
which a proportion of this kind actually holds (before
depreciation)&mdash;food, cars, machine tools.  There are even many
intangible goods for which sale value couples strongly to development
and replacement cost&mdash;rights to reproduce music or maps or
databases, for example.  Such goods may retain or even increase their
sale value after their original vendor is gone.</para>

<para>By contrast, when a software product's vendor goes out of business (or
if the product is merely discontinued), the maximum price consumers
will pay for it rapidly falls to near zero regardless of its
theoretical use value or the development cost of a functional
equivalent.  (To check this assertion, examine the remainder bins at
any software store near you.)</para>

<para>The behavior of retailers when a vendor folds is very revealing.
It tells us that they know something the vendors don't.  What they
know is this: the price a consumer will pay is effectively capped by
the <emphasis>expected future value of vendor service</emphasis>
(where `service' is here construed broadly to include enhancements,
upgrades, and follow-on projects).</para>

<para>In other words, software is largely a service industry operating
under the persistent but unfounded delusion that it is a manufacturing
industry.</para>

<para>It is worth examining why we normally tend to believe otherwise.
It may simply be because the small portion of the software industry
that manufactures for sale is also the only part that advertises its
product.  The common mental bias that regards manufacturing as more
`real' than services, because it produces things you can heft, may be
at work <link linkend="WG">[WG]</link>.  Also, some of the most
visible and heavily advertised products are ephemera like games that
have little in the way of continuing service requirements (the
exception, rather than the rule) <link
linkend="SH">[SH]</link>.</para>

<para>It is also worth noting that the manufacturing delusion encourages
price structures that are pathologically out of line with the actual
breakdown of development costs.  If (as is generally accepted) over
75% of a typical software project's life-cycle costs will be in
maintenance and debugging and extensions, then the common price policy
of charging a high fixed purchase price and relatively low or zero
support fees is bound to lead to results that serve all parties
poorly.</para>

<para>Consumers lose because, even though software is a service
industry, the incentives in the factory model all work against a
vendor's offering <emphasis>competent</emphasis> service.  If the
vendor's money comes from selling bits, most effort will go into
making bits and shoving them out the door; the help desk, not a profit
center, will become a dumping ground for the least effective employees
and get only enough resources to avoid actively alienating a critical
number of customers.</para>

<para>It gets worse.  Actual use means service calls, which cut into the
profit margin unless you're charging for service.  In the open-source
world, you seek the largest possible user base, so as to get maximum
feedback and the most vigorous possible secondary markets; in the
closed-source you seek as many buyers but as few actual users as
possible.  Therefore the logic of the factory model most strongly
rewards vendors who produce shelfware&mdash;software that is sufficiently
well marketed to make sales but actually useless in practice.</para>

<para>The other side of this coin is that most vendors buying this
factory model will also fail in the longer run.  Funding
indefinitely-continuing support expenses from a fixed price is only
viable in a market that is expanding quickly enough to cover the
support and life-cycle costs entailed in yesterday's sales with
tomorrow's revenues.  Once a market matures and sales slow down, most
vendors will have no choice but to cut expenses by orphaning the
product <link linkend="DPV">[DPV]</link>.</para>

<para>Whether this is done explicitly (by discontinuing the product) or
implicitly (by making support hard to get), it has the effect of
driving customers to competitors%mdash;because it destroys the product's
expected future value, which is contingent on that service.  In the
short run, one can escape this trap by making bug-fix releases pose as
new products with a new price attached, but consumers quickly tire of
this.  In the long run, therefore, the only way to escape is to have
no competitors&mdash;that is, to have an effective monopoly on one's
market.  In the end, there can be only one.</para>

<para>And, indeed, we have repeatedly seen this support-starvation failure
mode kill off even strong second-place competitors in a market niche.
(The pattern should be particularly clear to anyone who has ever 
surveyed the history of proprietary PC operating systems, word 
processors, accounting programs, or business software in general.) 
The perverse incentives set up by the factory model lead to a
winner-take-all market dynamic in which even the winner's customers
end up losing.</para>

<para>If not the factory model, then what?  To handle the real cost
structure of the software life cycle efficiently (in both the informal
and economics-jargon senses of `efficiency'), we require a price
structure founded on service contracts, subscriptions, and a
<emphasis>continuing</emphasis> exchange of value between vendor and
customer.  This is already the price structure of the largest merchant
software products such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems,
for which the development costs are so large that no fixed purchase
price could possibly cover them; firms like Baan and Peoplesoft
actually make their money from after-sale consulting fees.  Under
the efficiency-seeking conditions of the free market we can predict
that this is the sort of price structure most of a mature software
industry will ultimately follow.  </para>

<para>The foregoing begins to give us some insight into why
open-source software increasingly poses not merely a technological but
an economic challenge to the prevailing order.  The effect of making
software `free', it seems, is to force us into that
service-fee&ndash;dominated world&mdash;and to expose what a relatively weak
prop the sale value of the secret bits in closed-source software was
all along.</para>

<para>This transition will not be quite the wrench it may at first
appear.  Many consumers find that pirate copies of packaged software
(especially games, operating systems, and popular productivity tools)
are readily available to them.  Thus, many proprietary software sale
prices are, from the point of view of the consumer, only worth paying
as claims on other goods: vendor support, or the paper manuals, or a
feeling of virtuousness. Commercial distributions of so-called `free'
software often justify their price to the customer in exactly the same
way&mdash;the only difference is that their vendors do not fool
themselves into thinking that the bits alone necessarily have value to
the customer.</para>

<para>The term `free' is misleading in another way as well.  Lowering
the cost of a good tends to increase, rather than decrease, total
investment in the people and infrastructure that sustains it.  When
the price of cars goes down, the demand for auto mechanics goes
up&mdash;which is why even those 5% of programmers now compensated by
sale-value would be very unlikely to suffer in an open-source world.
The people who lose in the transition won't be programmers, they will
be investors who have bet on closed-source strategies where they're
not economically viable.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>The ``Information Wants to be Free'' Myth</title>

<para>There is another myth, equal and opposite to the factory-model
delusion, which often confuses peoples' thinking about the economics of
open-source software.  It is that ``information wants to be free''.
This usually unpacks to a claim that the zero marginal cost of
reproducing digital information implies that its clearing price ought
to be zero (or that a market full of duplicators will force it to 
zero).</para>

<para>Some kinds of information really do want to be free, in the weak
sense that their value goes up as more people have access to them&mdash;a
technical standards document is a good example.  But the myth that
<emphasis>all</emphasis> information wants to be free is readily
exploded by considering the value of information that constitutes a
privileged pointer to a rivalrous good&mdash;a treasure map, say, or a
Swiss bank account number, or a claim on services such as a computer
account password.  Even though the claiming information can be
duplicated at zero cost, the item being claimed cannot be.  Hence, the
non-zero marginal cost for the item can be inherited by the claiming
information.</para>

<para>We mention this myth mainly to assert that it is almost
unrelated to the economic-utility arguments for open source; as we'll
see later, those would generally hold up well even under the
assumption that software actually <emphasis>does</emphasis> have the
(nonzero) value structure of a manufactured good.  We therefore have
no need to tackle the question of whether software `should' be free or
not.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>The Inverse Commons</title>

<para>Having cast a skeptical eye on one prevailing model, let's see if we
can build another&mdash;a hard-nosed economic explanation of what makes
open-source cooperation sustainable.</para>

<para>This is a question that bears examination on a couple of different
levels.  On one level, we need to explain the behavior of individuals who
contribute to open-source projects; on another, we need to understand
the economic forces that sustain cooperation on open-source projects like
Linux or Apache.</para>

<para>Again, we must first demolish a widespread folk model that interferes
with understanding.  Over every attempt to explain cooperative 
behavior there looms the shadow of Garret Hardin's ``Tragedy of the
Commons''.</para>

<para>Hardin famously asks us to imagine a green held in common by a village
of peasants, who graze their cattle there.  But grazing degrades the
commons, tearing up grass and leaving muddy patches, which re-grow
their cover only slowly.  If there is no agreed-upon (and enforced!)
policy to allocate grazing rights that prevents overgrazing, all
parties' incentives push them to run as many cattle as quickly as
possible, trying to extract maximum value before the commons degrades
into a sea of mud.</para>

<para>Most people have an intuitive model of cooperative behavior that
goes much like this.  The tragedy of the commons actually stems from
two linked problems, one of overuse and another of underprovision.  On
the demand side, the commons situation encourages a race to the bottom
by overuse&mdash;what economists call a congested&ndash;public-good
problem.  On the supply side, the commons rewards free-rider
behavior&mdash;removing or diminishing incentives for individual
actors to invest in developing more pasturage.</para>

<para>The tragedy of the commons predicts only three possible outcomes.  One
is the sea of mud.  Another is for some actor with coercive power to
enforce an allocation policy on behalf of the village (the communist
solution).  The third is for the commons to break up as village
members fence off bits they can defend and manage sustainably (the
property-rights solution).</para>

<para>When people reflexively apply this model to open-source cooperation,
they expect it to be unstable with a short half-life.  Since there's
no obvious way to enforce an allocation policy for programmer time
over the Internet, this model leads straight to a prediction that the
commons will break up, with various bits of software being taken
closed-source and a rapidly decreasing amount of work being fed back
into the communal pool.</para>

<para>In fact, it is empirically clear that the trend is opposite to
this.  The trend in breadth and volume of open-source development can
be measured by submissions per day at Metalab and SourceForge (the
leading Linux source sites) or announcements per day at freshmeat.net
(a site dedicated to advertising new software releases).  Volume on
both is steadily and rapidly increasing.  Clearly there is some
critical way in which the ``Tragedy of the Commons'' model fails to
capture what is actually going on.</para>

<para>Part of the answer certainly lies in the fact that using
software does not decrease its value.  Indeed, widespread use of
open-source software tends to <emphasis>increase</emphasis> its value,
as users fold in their own fixes and features (code patches).  In this
inverse commons, the grass grows taller when it's grazed upon.</para>

<para>That this public good cannot be degraded by overuse takes care
of half of Hardin's tragedy, the congested&ndash;public-goods problem.
It doesn't explain why open source doesn't suffer from underprovision.
Why don't people who know the open-source community exists universally
exhibit free-rider behavior behavior, waiting for others to do the
work they need, or (if they do the work themselves) not bothering to
contribute the work back into the commons?</para>

<para>Part of the answer lies in the fact that people don't merely
need solutions, they need solutions <emphasis>on time</emphasis>. It's
seldom possible to predict when someone else will finish a given piece
of needed work.  If the payoff from fixing a bug or adding a feature
is sufficient to any potential contributor, that person will dive in
and do it (at which point the fact that everyone else is a free rider
becomes irrelevant).</para>

<para>Another part of the answer lies in the fact that the putative market
value of small patches to a common source base is hard to capture.
Supposing I write a fix for an irritating bug, and suppose many people
realize the fix has money value; how do I collect from all those
people?  Conventional payment systems have high enough overheads to
make this a real problem for the sorts of micropayments that would
usually be appropriate.</para>

<para>It may be more to the point that this value is not merely hard to
capture, in the general case it's hard to even <emphasis>assign</emphasis>.  
As a thought experiment, let us suppose that the Internet came 
equipped with the theoretically ideal micropayment system&mdash;secure,
universally accessible, zero-overhead.  Now let's say you have written a
patch labeled ``Miscellaneous Fixes to the Linux Kernel''.  How do you
know what price to ask?  How would a potential buyer, not having seen
the patch yet, know what is reasonable to pay for it?</para>

<para>What we have here is almost like a funhouse-mirror image of
F. A. Hayek's `calculation problem'&mdash;it would take a superbeing,
both able to evaluate the functional worth of patches and trusted to
set prices accordingly, to lubricate trade.</para>

<para>Unfortunately, there's a serious superbeing shortage, so patch author
J. Random Hacker is left with two choices: sit on the patch, or throw
it into the pool for free.</para>

<para>Sitting on the patch gains nothing. Indeed, it incurs a future
cost&mdash;the effort involved in re-merging the patch into the source
base in each new release.  So the payoff from this choice is actually
negative (and multiplied by the rapid release tempo characteristic of
open-source projects).</para>

<para>To put it more positively, the contributor gains by passing
maintainance overhead of the patch to the source-code owners and the 
rest of the project group.  He also gains because others will improve
on his work in the future.  Finally, because he won't have to maintain
the patch himself, he will be able to afford more time on other and
larger customizations to suit his needs.  The same arguments that
favor opening source for entire packages apply to patches as well.</para>

<para>Throwing the patch in the pool may gain nothing, or it may encourage
reciprocal effort from others that will address some of J. Random's
problems in the future.  This choice, apparently altruistic, is
actually optimally selfish in a game-theoretic sense.</para>

<para>In analyzing this kind of cooperation, it is important to note that
while there is a free-rider problem (work may be underprovided in the
absence of money or money-equivalent compensation) it is not one that
scales with the number of end users (see the endnote on <link
linkend="scaling">[ST]</link> for discussion).  The complexity and
communications overhead of an open-source project is almost entirely a
function of the number of developers involved; having more end users
who never look at source costs effectively nothing.  It may increase
the rate of silly questions appearing on the project mailing lists,
but this is relatively easily forestalled by maintaining a Frequently
Asked Questions list and blithely ignoring questioners who have
obviously not read it (and in fact both these practices are typical).</para>

<para>The real free-rider problems in open-source software are more a
function of friction costs in submitting patches than anything else.
A potential contributor with little stake in the cultural reputation
game (see <citetitle>Homesteading the Noosphere</citetitle> <link
linkend="HtN">[HtN]</link>) may, in the absence of money compensation,
think ``It's not worth submitting this fix because I'll have to clean
up the patch, write a ChangeLog entry, and sign the FSF assignment
papers...''.  It's for this reason that the number of contributors
(and, at second order, the success of projects) is strongly and
inversely correlated with the number of hoops each project makes a
contributing user go through.  Such friction costs may be political as
well as mechanical. Together I think they explain why the loose,
amorphous Linux culture has attracted orders of magnitude more
cooperative energy than the more tightly organized and centralized BSD
efforts&mdash;and why the Free Software Foundation has receded in
relative importance as Linux has risen.</para>

<para>This is all good as far as it goes.  But it is an after-the-fact
explanation of what J. Random Hacker does with his patch after he has
created it. The other half we need is an economic explanation of how
JRH was able to write that patch in the first place, rather than
having to work on a closed-source program that might have returned him
sale value.  What business models create niches in which open-source
development can flourish?</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Reasons for Closing Source</title>

<para>Before taxonomizing open-source business models, we should deal with
exclusion payoffs in general.  What exactly are we protecting when
we close source?</para>

<para>Let's say you hire someone to write to order (say) a specialized
accounting package for your business.  That problem won't be solved
any better if the sources are closed rather than open; the only
rational reasons you might want them to be closed is if you want to
sell the package to other people, or deny its use to competitors.</para>

<para>The obvious answer is that you're protecting sale value, but for the
95% of software written for internal use this doesn't apply.  So
what other gains are there in being closed?</para>

<para>That second case (protecting competitive advantage) bears a bit of
examination.  Suppose you open-source that accounting package.  It
becomes popular and benefits from improvements made by the community.
Now, your competitor also starts to use it.  The competitor gets the
benefit without paying the development cost and cuts into your
business.  Is this an argument against open-sourcing?</para>

<para>Maybe&mdash;and maybe not.  The real question is whether your gain from
spreading the development load exceeds your loss due to increased
competition from the free rider.  Many people tend to reason poorly
about this tradeoff through (a) ignoring the functional advantage of
recruiting more development help, and (b) not treating the development
costs as sunk. By hypothesis, you had to pay the development costs
anyway, so counting them as a cost of open-sourcing (if you choose to
do that) is mistaken.</para>

<para>Another reason often cited is the fear that disclosing source of a
particular special accounting function might be tantamount to
revealing confidential aspects of your business plan.  This is really
an argument not for closed source but against bad design; in a
properly-written accounting package, business knowledge should not be
expressed in code at all but rather in a schema or specification
language implemented by the accounting engine (for a closely parallel
case, consider the way that database schemas separate business
knowledge from the mechanics of the database engine).  The separation
of function would enable you to guard the crown jewels (the schema)
while getting maximum benefit from open-sourcing the engine.</para>

<para>There are other reasons for closing source that are outright
irrational.  You might, for example, be laboring under the delusion
that closing the sources will make your business systems more secure
against crackers and intruders.  If so, I recommend therapeutic
conversation with a cryptographer immediately.  The really
professional paranoids know better than to trust the security of
closed-source programs, because they've learned through hard
experience not to.  Security is an aspect of reliability; only
algorithms and implementations that have been thoroughly peer-reviewed
can possibly be trusted as secure.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Use-Value Funding Models</title>

<para>A key fact that the distinction between use and sale value
allows us to notice is that only <emphasis>sale value</emphasis> is
threatened by the shift from closed to open source; use value is
not.</para>

<para>If use value rather than sale value is really the major driver
of software development, and (as was argued in <citetitle>The
Cathedral and the Bazaar</citetitle> <link
linkend="CatB">[CatB]</link>) open-source development is really more
effective and efficient than closed, then we should expect to find
circumstances in which expected use value alone sustainably funds
open-source development.</para>

<para>And in fact it is not difficult to identify at least two important
models in which full-time developer salaries for open-source projects
are funded strictly out of use value.</para>

<sect2><title>The Apache Case: Cost-Sharing</title>

<para>Let's say you work for a firm that has a business-critical requirement
for a high-volume, high-reliability web server.  Maybe it's for
electronic commerce, maybe you're a high-visibility media outlet
selling advertising, maybe you're a portal site.  You need 24/7
uptime, you need speed, and you need customizability.</para>

<para>How are you going to get these things?  There are three basic
strategies you can pursue:</para>

<para><emphasis>Buy a proprietary web server.</emphasis> In this case,
you are betting that the vendor's agenda matches yours and that the
vendor has the technical competence to implement properly.  Even
assuming both these things to be true, the product is likely to come
up short in customizability; you will be able to modify it only
through the hooks the vendor has chosen to provide.  We can see from
the monthly Netcraft surveys that this proprietary path is not a
popular one, and is getting less popular all the time.</para>

<para><emphasis>Roll your own.</emphasis> Building your own web server
is not an option to dismiss instantly; web servers are not very
complex, certainly less so than browsers, and a specialized one can be
very lean and mean.  Going this path, you can get the exact features
and customizability you want, though you'll pay for it in development
time.  Your firm may also find it has a problem when you retire or
leave.</para>

<para><emphasis>Join the Apache group.</emphasis> The Apache server
was built by an Internet-connected group of webmasters who realized
that it was smarter to pool their efforts into improving one code base
than to run a large number of parallel development efforts.  By doing
this they were able to capture both most of the advantages of
roll-your-own and the powerful debugging effect of massively-parallel
peer review.</para>

<para>The advantage of the Apache choice is very strong. Just how
strong, we may judge from the monthly Netcraft survey, which has shown
Apache steadily gaining market share against all proprietary web
servers since its inception.  As of November 2000, Apache and its
derivatives have <ulink url="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">60%
market share</ulink>&mdash; with no legal owner, no promotion, and no
contracted service organization behind it at all.</para>

<para>The Apache story generalizes to a model in which competing
software users find it to their advantage to cooperatively fund
open-source development because doing so gets them a better product,
at lower cost, than they could otherwise have.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>The Cisco Case: Risk-Spreading</title>

<para>Some years ago, two programmers at Cisco (the networking-equipment
manufacturer) got assigned the job of writing a distributed
print-spooling system for use on Cisco's corporate network.  This
was quite a challenge.  Besides supporting the ability for arbitrary
user A to print at arbitrary printer B (which might be in the next
room or a thousand miles away), the system had to make sure that in
the event of a paper-out or toner-low condition the job would get
rerouted to an alternate printer near the target.  The system  also needed
to be able to report such problems to a printer administrator.</para>

<para>The duo came up with a <ulink
url="http://www.tpp.org/CiscoPrint/">clever set of
modifications</ulink> to the standard Unix print-spooler software,
plus some wrapper scripts, that did the job.  Then they realized that
they, and Cisco, had a problem.</para>

<para>The problem was that neither of them was likely to be at Cisco
forever.  Eventually, both programmers would be gone, and the software
would be unmaintained and begin to rot (that is, to gradually fall out
of sync with real-world conditions).  No developer likes to see this
happen to his or her work, and the intrepid duo felt Cisco had paid
for a solution under the not unreasonable expectation that it would
outlast their own employment there.</para>

<para>Accordingly, they went to their manager and urged him to authorize the
release of the print-spooler software as open source.  Their argument
was that Cisco would have no sale value to lose, and much else to
gain.  By encouraging the growth of a community of users and
co-developers spread across many corporations, Cisco could effectively
hedge against the loss of the software's original developers.</para>

<para>The Cisco story shows open source can function not only to lower
costs but to to spread and mitigate risk.  All parties find that the
openness of the source, and the presence of a collaborative community
funded by multiple independent revenue streams, provides a fail-safe
that is itself economically valuable&mdash;sufficiently valuable to
attract funding for it.</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>Why Sale Value is Problematic</title>

<para>Open source makes it rather difficult to capture direct sale
value from software.  The difficulty is not technical; source code is
no more nor less easily copied than binaries, and the enforcement of
copyright and license laws permitting capture of sale value would not
by necessity be any more difficult for open-source products than it is
for closed.</para>

<para>The difficulty lies rather with the nature of the social
contract that supports open-source development.  For three mutually
reinforcing reasons, the major open-source licenses prohibit most of
the sort of restrictions on use, redistribution and modification that
would facilitate direct-sale revenue capture.  To understand these
reasons, we must examine the social context within which the licenses
evolved; the Internet <ulink
url="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">hacker</ulink>
culture.</para>

<para>Despite myths about the hacker culture still too widely believed
outside it, none of these reasons has to do with hostility to the
market.  While a minority of hackers does indeed remain hostile to the
profit motive, the general willingness of the community to cooperate
with for-profit Linux packagers like Red Hat, SuSE, and Caldera
demonstrates that most hackers will happily work with the corporate
world when it serves their ends.  The real reasons hackers frown on
direct-revenue-capture licenses are more subtle and interesting.</para>

<para>One reason has to do with symmetry.  While most open-source
developers do not intrinsically object to others profiting from their
gifts, most also demand that no party (with the possible exception of
the originator of a piece of code) be in a
<emphasis>privileged</emphasis> position to extract profits.
J. Random Hacker is willing for Fubarco to profit by selling his
software or patches, but only so long as JRH himself could also
potentially do so.</para>

<para>Another has to do with unintended consequences.  Hackers have observed
that licenses that include restrictions on and fees for commercial
use or sale (the most common form of attempt to recapture direct sale
value, and not at first blush an unreasonable one) have serious
chilling effects.  A specific one is to cast a legal shadow on
activities like redistribution in inexpensive CD-ROM anthologies,
which we would ideally like to encourage.  More generally,
restrictions on use/sale/modification/distribution (and other
complications in licensing) exact an overhead for conformance tracking
and (as the number of packages people deal with rises) a combinatorial
explosion of perceived uncertainty and potential legal risk.  This outcome
is considered harmful, and there is therefore strong social pressure
to keep licenses simple and free of restrictions.</para>

<para>The final and most critical reason has to do with preserving the
peer-review, gift-culture dynamic described in <citetitle>Homesteading
the Noosphere</citetitle> <link linkend="HtN">[HtN]</link>.  License
restrictions designed to protect intellectual property or capture
direct sale value often have the effect of making it legally
impossible to fork the project. This is the case, for example, with
Sun's so-called "Community Source" licenses for Jini and Java.  While
forking is frowned upon and considered a last resort (for reasons
discussed at length in <citetitle>Homesteading the
Noosphere</citetitle>), it's considered critically important that that
last resort be present in case of maintainer incompetence or defection
(e.g., to a more closed license) <link
linkend="SSH">[SSH]</link>. </para>

<para>The hacker community has some give on the symmetry reason; thus,
it tolerates licenses like the Netscape Public License (NPL) that give
some profit privileges to the originators of the code (specifically in
the NPL case, the exclusive right to use the open-source Mozilla code
in derivative products including closed source).  It has less give on
the unintended-consequences reason, and none at all on preserving the
option to fork (which is why Sun's Java and Jini Sun Community Source
License schemes have been largely rejected by the community).</para>

<para>(It bears repeating here that nobody in the hacker community
<emphasis>wants</emphasis> projects to split into competing
development lines; indeed (as I observed in <citetitle>Homesteading
the Noosphere</citetitle>) there is very strong social pressure
against forking, for good reasons.  Nobody wants to be on a picket
line, in court, or in a firefight either.  But the right to fork is
like the right to strike, the right to sue, or the right to bear
arms&mdash;you don't want to have to exercise any of these rights, but
it's a signal of serious danger when anyone tries to take them
away.)</para>

<para>These reasons explain the clauses of the Open Source Definition,
which was written to express the consensus of the hacker community
regarding the critical features of the standard licenses (the GPL, the
BSD license, the MIT License, and the Artistic License).  These
clauses have the effect (though not the intention) of making direct
sale value very hard to capture.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Indirect Sale-Value Models</title>

<para>Nevertheless, there are ways to make markets in software-related
services that capture something like indirect sale value.  There
are five known and two speculative models of this kind (more may
be developed in the future).</para>

<sect2><title>Loss-Leader/Market Positioner</title>

<para>In this model, you use open-source software to create or maintain a
market position for proprietary software that generates a direct
revenue stream.  In the most common variant, open-source client
software enables sales of server software, or subscription/advertising 
revenue associated with a portal site.</para>

<para>Netscape Communications, Inc. was pursuing this strategy when it
open-sourced the Mozilla browser in early 1998.  The browser side of
their business was at 13% of revenues and dropping when Microsoft
first shipped Internet Explorer (IE).  Intensive marketing of IE (and
shady bundling practices that would later become the central issue of
an antitrust lawsuit) quickly ate into Netscape's browser market
share, creating concern that Microsoft intended to monopolize the
browser market and then use de-facto control of HTML and HTTP to drive
Netscape out of the server market.</para>

<para>By open-sourcing the still widely popular Netscape browser,
Netscape effectively denied Microsoft the possibility of a browser
monopoly.  They expected that open-source collaboration would
accelerate the development and debugging of the browser, and hoped
that Microsoft's IE would be reduced to playing catch-up and prevented
from exclusively defining HTML.</para>

<para>This strategy worked.  In November 1998 Netscape actually began to
regain business-market share from IE.  By the time Netscape was
acquired by AOL in early 1999, the competitive advantage of
keeping Mozilla in play was sufficiently clear that one of AOL's first
public commitments was to continue supporting the Mozilla project,
even though it was still in alpha stage.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Widget Frosting</title>

<para>This model is for hardware manufacturers (hardware, in this context,
includes anything from Ethernet or other peripheral boards all the way
up to entire computer systems).  Market pressures have forced hardware
companies to write and maintain software (from device drivers through
configuration tools all the way up to the level of entire operating
systems), but the software itself is not a profit center.  It's an
overhead&mdash;often a substantial one.</para>

<para>In this situation, opening source is a no-brainer.  There's no
revenue stream to lose, so there's no downside.  What the vendor gains
is a dramatically larger developer pool, more rapid and flexible
response to customer needs, and better reliability through peer
review.  It gets ports to other environments for free. It probably
also gains increased customer loyalty as its customers' technical
staffs put increasing amounts of time into the code to improve the
source as they require.</para>

<para>There are a couple of vendor objections commonly raised
specifically to open-sourcing hardware drivers.  Rather than mix these
objections with discussion of more general issues here, I have written
an <link linkend="drivers">afterword</link> specifically on this
topic.</para>

<para>The `future-proofing' effect of open source is particularly
strong with respect to widget frosting.  Hardware products have a
finite production and support lifetime; after that, the customers are
on their own.  But if they have access to driver source and can patch
those drivers as needed, they're more likely to be happier repeat
customers.</para>

<para>A very dramatic example of adopting the widget frosting model was
Apple Computer's decision in mid-March 1999 to open-source "Darwin",
the core of their Mac OS X operating system.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Give Away the Recipe, Open a Restaurant</title>

<para>In this model, one open-sources software to create a market position
not for closed software (as in the loss-leader/market-positioner case)
but for services.</para>

<para>(I used to call this `Give Away the Razor, Sell Razor Blades', but the
coupling is not really as close as the razor/razor-blade analogy
implies.)</para>

<para>This model was first used by Cygnus Solutions, arguably the first open
source business (1989).  At the time, the GNU tools provided a common
development environment across several machines, but each tool used a
different configuration process and required a different set of patches
to run on each platform.  Cygnus domesticated the GNU tools and created
the "configure" script to unify the build process (the recipe), and then
sold support services and binaries bundled with their version of the GNU
tools (the restaurant).  In accordance with the GPL, they permitted
customers to freely use, distribute, and modify the software that they
distributed, but the service contract could be terminated (or a higher
fee had to be paid) if there were more users at the site using the
support services than were accounted for in the contract (no sharing at
the salad bar).</para>

<para>This also is what Red Hat and other Linux distributors do.  What they
are actually selling is not the software, the bits itself, but the
value added by assembling and testing a running operating system that
is warranted (if only implicitly) to be merchantable and to be
plug-compatible with other operating systems carrying the same brand.
Other elements of their value proposition include free installation
support and the provision of options for continuing support contracts.</para>

<para>The market-building effect of open source can be extremely powerful,
especially for companies that are inevitably in a service position
to begin with.  One very instructive recent case is Digital
Creations, a website-design house started up in 1998 that specializes
in complex database and transaction sites.  Their major tool, the
intellectual-property crown jewels of the company, is an object
publisher that has been through several names and incarnations but
is now called Zope.</para>

<para>When the Digital Creations people went looking for venture
capital, the venture capitalist they brought in carefully evaluated
their prospective market niche, their people, and their tools.  The VC
then recommended that Digital Creations take Zope open-source.</para>

<para>By traditional software industry standards, this looks like an
absolutely crazy move.  Conventional business school wisdom has it
that core intellectual property like Zope is a company's crown jewels,
never under any circumstances to be given away.  But the VC had two
related insights.  One is that Zope's true core asset is actually the
brains and skills of its people.  The second is that Zope is likely
to generate more value as a market-builder than as a secret tool.</para>

<para>To see this, compare two scenarios.  In the conventional one,
Zope remains Digital Creations's secret weapon.  Let's stipulate that
it's a very effective one.  As a result, the firm will able to deliver
superior quality on short schedules&mdash;<emphasis>but nobody knows
that</emphasis>.  It will be easy to satisfy customers, but harder to
build a customer base to begin with.</para>

<para>The VC, instead, saw that open-sourcing Zope could be critical
advertising for Digital Creations's <emphasis>real</emphasis>
asset&mdash; its people.  He expected that customers evaluating Zope
would consider it more efficient to hire the experts than to develop
in-house Zope expertise.</para>

<para>One of the Zope principals has since confirmed very publicly
that their open-source strategy has "opened many doors we wouldn't
have got in otherwise" [sic].  Potential customers do indeed respond
to the logic of the situation&mdash;and Digital Creations,
accordingly, is prospering.</para>

<para>Another up-to-the-minute example is <ulink
url="http://www.e-smith.net/">e-smith, inc.</ulink>. This company
sells support contracts for turnkey Internet server software that is
open-source, a customized Linux.  One of the principals, describing
the spread of free downloads of e-smith's software, <ulink
url="http://www.globetechnology.com/gam/News/19990625/BAND.html">says</ulink>
``Most companies would consider that software piracy; we consider it
free marketing''.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Accessorizing</title>

<para>In this model, you sell accessories for open-source software.  At the
low end, mugs and T-shirts; at the high end, professionally-edited and
produced documentation.</para>

<para>O'Reilly &amp; Associates Inc., publishers of many excellent
reference volumes on open-source software, is a good example of an
accessorizing company.  O'Reilly actually hires and supports
well-known open-source hackers (such as Larry Wall and Brian
Behlendorf) as a way of building its reputation in its chosen
market.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Free the Future, Sell the Present</title>

<para>In this model, you release software in binaries and source with a
closed license, but one that includes an expiration date on the
closure provisions.  For example, you might write a license that
permits free redistribution, forbids commercial use without fee, and
guarantees that the software come under GPL terms a year after
release or if the vendor folds.</para>

<para>Under this model, customers can ensure that the product is
customizable to their needs, because they have the source.  The
product is future-proofed&mdash;the license guarantees that an open
source community can take over the product if the original company
dies.</para>

<para>Because the sale price and volume are based on these customer
expectations, the original company should enjoy enhanced revenues from
its product versus releasing it with an exclusively closed-source
license.  Furthermore, as older code is GPLed, it will get serious peer
review, bug fixes, and minor features, which removes some of the 75%
maintainance burden on the originator.</para>

<para>This model has been successfully pursued by Aladdin Enterprises,
makers of the popular Ghostscript program (a PostScript interpreter
that can translate to the native languages of many printers).</para>

<para>The main drawback of this model is that the closure provisions
tend to inhibit peer review and participation early in the product
cycle, precisely when they are needed most.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Free the Software, Sell the Brand</title>

<para>This is a speculative business model.  You open-source a software 
technology, retain a test suite or set of compatibility criteria,
then sell users a brand certifying that their implementation of
the technology is compatible with all others wearing the brand.</para>

<para>(This is how Sun Microsystems ought to be handling Java and Jini.)</para>

<para>Update: in July 2000, Sun sannounced that it would open-sourc
its Star Office, and that they would be selling the use of the Star
Office brand to lines of development of that codebase that pass Sun's
validation suite.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Free the Software, Sell the Content</title>

<para>This is another speculative business model.  Imagine something like a
stock-ticker subscription service.  The value is neither in the client
software nor the server but in providing objectively reliable
information.  So you open-source all the software and sell
subscriptions to the content.  As hackers port the client to new
platforms and enhance it in various ways, your market automatically
expands.</para>

<para>(This is why AOL ought to open-source its client software.)</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>When to be Open, When to be Closed</title>

<para>Having reviewed business models that support open-source software
development, we can now approach the general question of when it makes 
economic sense to be open-source and when to be closed-source.  First, we
must be clear what the payoffs are from each strategy.</para>

<sect2><title>What Are the Payoffs?</title>

<para>The closed-source approach allows you to collect rent from your
secret bits; on the other hand, it forecloses the possibility of truly
independent peer review.  The open-source approach sets up conditions
for independent peer review, but you don't get rent from your secret
bits.</para>

<para>The payoff from having secret bits is well understood; traditionally,
software business models have been constructed around it.  Until
recently, the payoff from independent peer review was not well
understood.  The Linux operating system, however, drives home a lesson
that we should probably have learned years ago from the history of the
Internet's core software and other branches of engineering&mdash;that
open-source peer review is the only scalable method for achieving 
high reliability and quality.</para>

<para>In a competitive market, therefore, customers seeking high
reliability and quality will reward software producers who go
open-source and discover how to maintain a revenue stream in the
service, value-add, and ancilliary markets associated with software.
This phenomenon is what's behind the astonishing success of Linux,
which came from nowhere in 1996 to be the second-most-popular
operating system in the business server market by mid-2000 (and some
surveys actually showed it passing Microsoft's share in late 2000).
In early 1999 IDC projected that Linux would grow faster than all
other operating systems combined through 2003; this projection has
held true so far.</para>

<para>An almost equally important payoff of open source is its utility
as a way to propagate open standards and build markets around them.
The dramatic growth of the Internet owes much to the fact that nobody
owns TCP/IP; nobody has a proprietary lock on the core Internet
protocols.</para>

<para>The network effects behind TCP/IP's and Linux's success are
fairly clear and reduce ultimately to issues of trust and
symmetry&mdash;potential parties to a shared infrastructure can
rationally trust it more if they can see how it works all the way
down, and will prefer an infrastructure in which all parties have
symmetrical rights to one in which a single party is in a privileged
position to extract rents or exert control.</para>

<para>It is not, however, actually necessary to assume network effects in
order for symmetry issues to be important to software consumers.  No
software consumer will rationally choose to lock itself into a
supplier-controlled monopoly by becoming dependent on closed source if
any open-source alternative of acceptable quality is available.  This
argument gains force as the software becomes more critical to the 
software consumer's business&mdash;the more vital it is, the less the
consumer can tolerate having it controlled by an outside party.</para>

<para>There's a flip side to this.  Economists know that, in general,
asymmetric information makes markets work poorly.  Higher-quality
goods get driven out when it's more lucrative to collect rent on
privileged information than it is to invest in producing better
products.  In general, not just in software, secrecy is the enemy of
quality.</para>

<para>Finally, an important customer payoff of open-source software related
to the trust issue is that it's future-proof.  If sources are open,
the customer has some recourse if the vendor goes belly-up.  This may
be particularly important for widget frosting, since hardware tends to
have short life cycles, but the effect is more general and translates
into increased value for all kinds of open-source software.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>How Do They Interact?</title>

<para>When the rent from secret bits is higher than the return from open
source, it makes economic sense to be closed-source.  When the return
from open source is higher than the rent from secret bits, it makes 
sense to go open source.</para>

<para>In itself, this is a trivial observation.  It becomes nontrivial when
we notice that the payoff from open source is harder to measure and
predict than the rent from secret bits&mdash;and that said payoff is
grossly underestimated much more often than it is overestimated.
Indeed, until the mainstream business world began to rethink its
premises following the Mozilla source release in early 1998, the
open-source payoff was incorrectly but very generally assumed to be
zero.</para>

<para>So how can we evaluate the payoff from open source?  It's a difficult
question in general, but we can approach it as we would any other
predictive problem.  We can start from observed cases where the
open-source approach has succeeded or failed.  We can try to
generalize to a model that gives at least a qualitative feel for
the contexts in which open source is a net win for the investor or
business trying to maximize returns.  We can then go back to the data
and try to refine the model.</para>

<para>From the analysis presented in <citetitle>The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</citetitle> <link linkend="CatB">[CatB]</link>, we can expect
that open source has a high payoff where (a)
reliability/stability/scalability are critical, and (b) correctness of
design and implementation is not readily verified by means other than
independent peer review.  (The second criterion is met in practice by
most non-trivial programs.)</para>

<para>A consumer's rational desire to avoid being locked into a monopoly 
supplier will increase its interest in open source (and, hence, the
competitive-market value for suppliers of going open) as the software
becomes more critical to that consumer.  Thus, another criterion (c)
pushes towards open source when the software is a business-critical
capital good (as, for example, in many corporate MIS departments).</para>

<para>As for application area, we observed above that open-source
infrastructure creates trust and symmetry effects that, over time,
will tend to attract more customers and to outcompete closed-source
infrastructure; and it is often better to have a smaller piece of such
a rapidly-expanding market than a bigger piece of a closed and
stagnant one.  Accordingly, for infrastructure software, an
open-source play for ubiquity is quite likely to have a higher
long-term payoff than a closed-source play for rent from intellectual
property.</para>

<para>In fact, the ability of potential customers to reason about the future
consequences of vendor strategies and their reluctance to accept a
supplier monopoly implies a stronger constraint; without already
having overwhelming market power, you can choose either an open-source
ubiquity play or a direct-revenue-from-closed-source play&mdash;but not
both.  (Analogues of this principle are visible elsewhere&mdash;e.g., in
electronics markets where customers often refuse to buy sole-source
designs.)  The case can be put less negatively: where network effects
(positive network externalities) dominate, open source is likely to be
the right thing.</para>

<para>We may sum up this logic by observing that open source seems to be
most successful in generating greater returns than is closed source in
software that (d) establishes or enables a common computing and
communications infrastructure.</para>

<para>Finally, we may note that purveyors of unique or just highly
differentiated services have more incentive to fear the copying of
their methods by competitors than do vendors of services for which the
critical algorithms and knowledge bases are well understood.
Accordingly, open source is more likely to dominate when (e) key
methods (or functional equivalents) are part of common engineering
knowledge.</para>

<para>The Internet core software, Apache, and Linux's implementation
of the standard Unix API are prime exemplars of all five criteria.
The path towards open source in the evolution of such markets are
well-illustrated by the reconvergence of data networking on TCP/IP in
the mid-1990s following fifteen years of failed empire-building
attempts with closed protocols such as DECNET, XNS, IPX, and the
like.</para>

<para>On the other hand, open source seems to make the least sense for
companies that have unique possession of a value-generating software
technology (strongly fulfilling criterion (e)) which is (a) relatively
insensitive to failure, which can (b) readily be verified by means
other than independent peer review, which is not (c)
business-critical, and which would not have its value substantially
increased by (d) network effects or ubiquity.</para>

<para>As an example of this extreme case, in early 1999 I was asked "Should
we go open source?"  by a company that writes software to calculate
cutting patterns for sawmills that want to extract the maximum yardage
of planks from logs.  My conclusion was ``No.''  The only criterion
this comes even close to fulfilling is (c); but at a pinch, an 
experienced operator could generate cut patterns by hand.</para>

<para>Note that my answer night have been very different if the
cut-pattern calculator had been written by a sawmill-equipment
manufacturer. In that case, opening the code would have increased the
value of the associated hardware they were selling.  Also note
that if some open-source cut-pattern calculator already existed (perhaps
the one written by the sawmill-equipment manufacturer) the
closed-source product would have trouble competing with it&mdash;not
so much for reasons of price, but because customers would perceive
on open-source advantage in customizability and other traits.</para>

<para>An important point is that where a particular product or technology
sits on these scales may change over time, as we'll see in the
following case study.</para>

<sect2><title>Doom: A Case Study</title>

<para>The history of id software's best-selling game Doom illustrates ways
in which market pressure and product evolution can critically change
the payoff magnitudes for closed versus open source.</para>

<para>When Doom was first released in late 1993, its first-person,
real-time animation made it utterly unique (the antithesis of
criterion (e)).  Not only was the visual impact of the techniques
stunning (far exceeding the flat-world animation in its predecessor
Wolfenstein 3D), but for many months nobody could figure out how it
had been achieved on the underpowered microprocessors of that time.
These secret bits were worth some very serious rent.  In addition, the
potential payoff from open source was low.  As a solo game, the
software (a) incurred tolerably low costs on failure, (b) was not
tremendously hard to verify, (c) was not business-critical for any
consumer, (d) did not benefit from network effects.  It was
economically rational for Doom to be closed source.</para>

<para>However, the market around Doom did not stand still.  Would-be
competitors invented functional equivalents of its animation
techniques, and other ``first-person shooter'' games like Duke Nukem
began to appear.  As these games ate into Doom's market share, the
value of the rent from secret bits went down.</para>

<para>On the other hand, efforts to expand that share brought on new
technical challenges&mdash;better reliability, more game features, a
larger user base, and multiple platforms.  With the advent of
multiplayer `deathmatch' play and Doom gaming services, the market
began to display substantial network effects.  All this was demanding
programmer-hours that id would have preferred to spend on the next
game.</para>

<para>From the time the game was first released, id had looked benignly on
the publication of technical specs that helped people to create data
objects for the game, and occasionally cooperated directly with
hackers by answering specific questions or publishing an existing
specs document of their own. They also encouraged the Internet
distribution of new Doom data.</para>

<para>The technical and market trends raised the payoff from opening the
source; Doom's opening of specifications and encouragement of
third-party add-ons increased the perceived value of the game and
created a secondary market for them to exploit. At some point the
payoff curves crossed over and it became economically rational for id
to shift to making money in that secondary market (with products such as
game-scenario anthologies) and then open up the Doom source.  Sometime
after this point, it actually happened.  The full source for Doom was
released in late 1997.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Knowing When to Let Go</title>

<para>Doom makes an interesting case study because it is neither an
operating system nor communications/networking software; it is thus
far removed from the usual and obvious examples of open-source
success.  Indeed, Doom's life cycle, complete with crossover point,
may be coming to typify that of applications software in today's code
ecology&mdash;one in which communications and distributed computation
both create serious robustness/reliability/scalability problems only
addressible by peer review, and frequently cross boundaries both
between technical environments and between competing actors (with all
the trust and symmetry issues that implies).</para>

<para>Doom evolved from solo to deathmatch play.  Increasingly, the
network effect <emphasis>is</emphasis> the computation.  Similar
trends are visible even in the heaviest business applications, such as
ERP systems, as businesses network ever more intensively with
suppliers and customers&mdash;and, of course, they are implicit in the
whole architecture of the World Wide Web.  It follows that almost
everywhere, the open-source payoff is steadily increasing.</para>

<para>If present trends continue, the central challenge of software
technology and product management in the next century will be knowing
when to let go&mdash;when to allow closed code to pass into the
open-source infrastructure in order to exploit the peer-review effect
and capture higher returns in service and other secondary markets.</para>

<para>There are obvious revenue incentives not to miss the crossover point
too far in either direction.  Beyond that, there's a serious
opportunity risk in waiting too long&mdash;you could get scooped by
a competitor going open-source in the same market niche.</para>

<para>The reason this is a serious issue is that both the pool of users and
the pool of talent available to be recruited into open-source
cooperation for any given product category is limited, and recruitment
tends to stick.  If two producers are the first and second to
open-source competing code of roughly equal function, the first is
likely to attract the most users and the most and best-motivated
co-developers; the second will have to take leavings.  Recruitment
tends to stick, as users gain familiarity and developers sink time
investments in the code itself.</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>Open Source as a Strategic Weapon</title>

<para>Sometimes, open-sourcing can be effective not just as a way to
grow markets but as a strategic maneuver against a company's
competition.  It will be fruitful to re-examine some of the business
tactics described above from that angle; not directly as revenue
generators but as ways to break into and reshape markets.</para>

<sect2><title>Cost-sharing as a competitive weapon</title>

<para>Earlier, we considered Apache as an example of better and
cheaper infrastructure development through cost-sharing in an
open-source project.  For software and systems vendors competing
against Microsoft and its IIS web server, the Apache project is also a
competitive weapon.  It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, for
any other single web server vendor to completely offset the advantages
of Microsoft's huge war chest and desktop-monopoly market power.  But
Apache enables each corporate participant in the project to offer a
webserver that is both technically superior to IIS and reassures
customers with a majority market share&mdash;at far lower cost. This
improves the market position and cost of production for value-added 
electronic-commerce products (like IBM's WebSphere).</para>

<para>This generalizes.  Open, shared infrastructure gives its
participants competitive advantages. One is lower cost per
participant to produce salable products and services.  Another is a
market position that reassures customers that they are much less
likely to be stuck with orphaned technology as a result of one
vendor's change in strategy or tactics.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Resetting the competition</title>

<para>When the development of the open-source X window system was
funded by DEC in the 180s, their explicit goal was to `reset the
competition'.  At the time there were several competing alternative
graphics environments for Unix in play, notably including Sun
Microsystems's NeWS system.  DEC strategists believed (probably
correctly) that if Sun were able to establish a proprietary graphics
standard it would get a lock on the booming Unix-workstation market.
By funding X and lending it engineers, and by allying with many
smaller vendors to establish X as a de-facto standard, DEC was able to
neutralize advantages held by Sun and other competitors with more
in-house expertise in graphics. This moved the focus of competition in
theworkstation market towards hardware, where DEC was historically
strong.</para>

<para>This too generalizes.  Open source is attractive to smart
customers, and to potential allies not large enough to fund competive
development on their own.  An open-source project, pitched at the
right time, can do better than just competing successfully against
closed-source alternatives; it can actually prevent them from getting
traction in the marketplace, resetting the competition and redirecting
it from an area where the initiating company is weak to one where it
is strong.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Growing the pond</title>

<para>Red Hat Software funded the development of the RPM packaging
system in order to give the Linux world a standard binary package
installer.  By doing so, they bet that the increased confidence
such a standard installer would give potential customers would be
worth more in future revenue than either the development cost of the 
software or the revenue potentially lost to competitors also
able to use it.</para>

<para>Sometimes the smartest way to become a bigger frog is to make
the pond grow faster.  This, of course, is the economic reason
technology firms have participated in public standards&mdash;and it's
useful to think of open-source software as an executable standard.
Besides being an excellent market builder, this strategy can be a
direct competitive weapon when a small company uses it to offset the
mass and market power of a much larger company outside the
standards-based alliance.  In Red Hat's case, the obvious and
acknowledged big competitor is Microsoft; standardization on RPM
across most Linux distributions went a significant way towards
neutralizing advantages Microsoft had previously held in ease of
system administration on its Windows machines.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Preventing a choke hold</title>

<para>In explaining the loss-leader/market-positioner business model above,
I described how Netscape's open-sourcing of the Mozilla browser was
a (successful) maneuver aimed at preventing Microsoft from effectively
locking up HTML markup and the HTTP protocol</para> 

<para>Often, it's more important to prevent your competition from
getting a chokehold on a particular technology than it is to control
the technology yourself.  By open-sourcing, you greatly increase the
potential size of your blocking coalition.</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>Open Source and Strategic Business Risk</title>

<para>Ultimately, the reasons open source seems destined to become a
widespread practice have more to do with customer demand and market
pressures than with supply-side efficiencies for vendors.  I have
already discussed, from the vendor's point of view, the effects of
customer demand for reliability and for infrastructure with no single
dominant player, and how these have played out historically in the
evolution of networking.  There is more to be said, though, about the
behavior of customers in a market where open source is a
factor.</para>

<para>Put yourself for the moment in the position of a CTO at a
Fortune 500 corporation contemplating a build or upgrade of your
firm's IT infrastructure.  Perhaps you need to choose a network
operating system to be deployed enterprise-wide; perhaps your concerns
involve 24/7 web service and e-commerce; perhaps your business depends
on being able to field high-volume, high-reliability transaction
databases.</para>

<para>Suppose you go the conventional closed-source route.  If you do,
then you put your firm at the mercy of a supplier
monopoly&mdash;because by definition, there is only one place you can
go for support, bug fixes, and enhancements.  If the supplier doesn't
perform, you will have no effective recourse because you are
effectively locked in by your initial investment and training costs.
Your supplier knows this.  Under these circumstances, do you suppose
the software will change to meet <emphasis>your</emphasis> needs and
<emphasis>your</emphasis> business plan...or your
<emphasis>supplier's</emphasis> needs and your
<emphasis>supplier's</emphasis> business plan?</para>

<para>The brutal truth is this: when your key business processes are
executed by opaque blocks of bits that you can't even see inside (let
alone modify) <emphasis>you have lost control of your
business</emphasis>. You need your supplier more than your supplier
needs you&mdash;and you will pay, and pay, and pay again for that power
imbalance.  You'll pay in higher prices, you'll pay in lost
opportunities, and you'll pay in lock-in that grows worse over time as
the supplier (who has refined its game on a lot of previous victims)
tightens its hold.</para>

<para>Contrast this with the open-source choice.  If you go that
route, <emphasis> you have the source code</emphasis>, and no one can
take it away from you. Instead of a supplier monopoly with a chokehold
on your business, you now have multiple service companies bidding for
your business&mdash;and you not only get to play them against each other,
you have the option of building your own captive support organization
if that looks less expensive than contracting out.  The market works
for <emphasis>you</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The logic is compelling; depending on closed source code is an
unacceptable strategic business risk.  So much so that I believe it
will not be very long until closed-source single-vendor acquisitions
when there is an open-source alternative available will be viewed as
actual fiduciary irresponsibility, and rightly grounds for a
shareholder lawsuit.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>The Business Ecology of Open Source</title>

<para>The open-source community has organized itself in a way that tends to
amplify the productivity effects of open source.  In the Linux world,
in particular, it's an economically significant fact that there are
multiple competing Linux distributors which form a tier separate from
the developers.</para>

<para>Developers write code, and make the code available over the Internet.
Each distributor selects some subset of the available code, integrates
and packages and brands it, and sells it to customers.  Users 
choose among distributions, and may supplement a distribution by
downloading code directly from developer sites.</para>

<para>The effect of this tier separation is to create a very fluid internal
market for improvements. Developers compete with each other, for the
attention of distributors and users, on the quality of their software.
Distributors compete for user dollars on the appropriateness of their
selection policies, and on the value they can add to the software.</para>

<para>A first-order effect of this internal market structure is that no
node in the net is indispensible.  Developers can drop out; even if their
portion of the code base is not picked up directly by some other
developer, the competition for attention will tend to rapidly generate
functional alternatives.  Distributors can fail without damaging or
compromising the common open-source code base.  The ecology as a whole
has a more rapid response to market demands, and more capability to
resist shocks and regenerate itself, than any monolithic vendor of a
closed-source operating system can possibly muster.</para>

<para>Another important effect is to lower overhead and increase
efficiency through specialization.  Developers don't experience the
pressures that routinely compromise conventional closed projects and
turn them into tar-pits&mdash;no lists of pointless and distracting
check-list features from Marketing, no management mandates to use
inappropriate and outdated languages or development environments, no
requirement to reinvent wheels in a new and incompatible way in the
name of product differentiation or intellectual-property protection,
and (most importantly) <emphasis>no deadlines</emphasis>.  No rushing
a 1.0 out the door before it's done right.  De Marco and Lister
observed in their discussion of the `wake me when it's over'
management style in ``Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams''
<link linkend="DL">[DL]</link> that this generally conduces not only
to higher quality but actually to the most rapid delivery of a
working result.</para>

<para>Distributors, on the other hand, get to specialize in the things
distributors can do most effectively.  Freed of the need to fund
massive and ongoing software development just to stay competitive,
they can concentrate on system integration, packaging, quality 
assurance, and service.</para>

<para>Both distributors and developers are kept honest by the constant
feedback from and monitoring by users that is an integral part of the
open-source method.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Coping with Success</title>

<para>The Tragedy of the Commons may not be applicable to open-source
development as it happens today, but that doesn't mean there are not
any reasons to wonder if the present momentum of the open-source
community is sustainable.  Will key players defect from cooperation as
the stakes become higher?</para>

<para>There are several levels on which this question can be asked.  Our
`Comedy of the Commons' counter-story is based on the argument that
the value of individual contributions to open source is hard to
monetize.  But this argument has much less force for firms (like, say,
Linux distributors) that already have a revenue stream associated
with open source.  Their contribution is already being monetized
every day.  Is their present cooperative role stable?</para>

<para>Examining this question will lead us to some interesting insights about
the economics of open-source software in the real world of present
time&mdash;and about what a true service-industry paradigm implies for
the software industry in the future.</para>

<para>On the practical level, applied to the open-source community as it
exists now, this question is usually posed in one of two different
ways.  One: will Linux fragment?  Two: conversely, will Linux develop
a dominant, quasi-monopolistic player?</para>

<para>The historical analogy many people turn to when considering if
Linux will fragment is the behavior of the proprietary-Unix vendors in
the 1980s.  Despite endless talk of open standards, despite numerous
alliances and consortia and agreements, proprietary Unix fell apart.
The vendors' desire to differentiate their products by adding and
modifying operating-system facilities proved stronger than their
interest in growing the total size of the Unix market by maintaining
compatibility (and consequently lowering both entry barriers for
independent software developers and total cost of ownership for
consumers).</para>

<para>This is quite unlikely to happen to Linux, for the simple reason that
all the distributors are constrained to operate from a common base of
open source code.  It's not really possible for any one of them to
maintain differentiation, because the licenses under which Linux code
are developed effectively require them to share code with all parties.
The moment any distributor develops a feature, all competitors are
free to clone it.</para>

<para>Since all parties understand this, nobody even thinks about
doing the kinds of maneuvers that fragmented proprietary Unix.
Instead, Linux distributors are forced to compete in ways that
actually <emphasis>benefit</emphasis> the consumer and the overall
market.  That is, they must compete on service, on support, and their
design bets on what interfaces actually conduce to ease installation
and use.</para>

<para>The common source base also forecloses the possibility of
monopolization.  When Linux people worry about this, the name usually
muttered is ``Red Hat'', that of the largest and most successful of
the distributors (with somewhere around 90% estimated market share in
the U.S.).  But it is notable that within days after the May 1999
announcement of Red Hat's long-awaited 6.0 release&mdash;before Red Hat's
CD-ROMs actually shipped in any quantity&mdash;CD-ROM images of the release
built from Red Hat's own public FTP site were being advertised by a
book publisher and several other CD-ROM distributors at lower prices
than Red Hat's expected list price.</para>

<para>Red Hat itself didn't turn a hair at this, because its founders
understand very clearly that they do not and cannot own the bits in
their product; the social norms of the Linux community forbid that.
In a latter-day take on John Gilmore's famous observation that the
Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it, it has
been aptly said that the hacker community responsible for Linux
interprets attempts at control as damage and routes around them.
For Red Hat to have protested the pre-release cloning of its newest
product would have seriously compromised its ability to elicit
future cooperation from its developer community.</para>

<para>Perhaps more importantly in present time, the software licenses
that express these community norms in a binding legal form actively
forbid Red Hat from monopolizing the sources of the code on which
their product is based.  The only thing they can sell is a
brand/service/support relationship with people who are freely willing
to pay for that.  This is not a context in which the possibility of a
predatory monopoly looms very large.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Open R&amp;D and the Reinvention of Patronage</title>

<para>There is one other respect in which the infusion of real money into the 
open-source world is changing it.  The community's stars are
increasingly finding they can get paid for what they want to do,
instead of pursuing open source as a hobby funded by another day job.
Corporations like Red Hat, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, and VA Linux Systems
are building what amount to semi-independent research arms with
charters to hire and maintain stables of open-source talent.</para>

<para>This makes economic sense only if the cost per head of maintaining
such a lab can easily be paid out of the expected gains it will achieve
by growing the firm's market faster.  O'Reilly can afford to pay the
leaders of Perl and Apache to do their thing because it expects their
efforts will enable it to sell more Perl- and Apache-related books and
draw more people to its conferences.  VA Linux Systems can fund its
laboratory branch because improving Linux boosts the use value of the
workstations and servers it sells.  And Red Hat funds Red Hat Advanced
Development Labs to increase the value of its Linux offering and
attract more customers.</para>

<para>To strategists from more traditional sectors of the software industry,
reared in cultures that regard patent- or trade-secret&ndash;protected
intellectual property as the corporate crown jewels, this behavior may
(despite its market-growing effect) seem inexplicable.  Why fund
research that every one of your competitors is (by definition) free to
appropriate at no cost?</para>

<para>There seem to be two controlling reasons.  One is that as long
as these companies remain dominant players in their market niches,
they can expect to capture a proportional lion's share of the returns
from the open research and development.  Using R&amp;D to buy future
profits is hardly a novel idea; what's interesting is the implied
calculation that the expected future gains are sufficiently large that
these companies can readily tolerate free riders in order to get the
peer-review effect.</para>

<para>While this obvious expected-future-value analysis is a necessary
one in a world of hard-nosed capitalists keeping their eyes on
return-on-investment, it is not actually the most interesting mode of
explanation for star-hiring, because the firms themselves advance a
fuzzier one.  They will tell you if asked that they are simply doing
the right thing by the community they come from.  Your humble author
is sufficiently well-acquainted with principals at all three of the
firms cited above to testify that these protestations cannot be
dismissed as humbug.  Indeed, I was personally recruited onto the
board of VA Linux Systems in late 1998 explicitly so that I would be
available to advise them on ``the right thing'', and have found them
far from unwilling to listen when I did so.</para>

<para>An economist is entitled to ask what payoff is involved here.  If we
accept that talk of doing the right thing is not empty posturing, we
should next inquire what self-interest of the firm the ``right thing''
serves.  Nor is the answer, in itself, either surprising or difficult
to verify by asking the right questions. As with superficially
altruistic behavior in other industries, what these firms actually
believe they're buying is goodwill.</para>

<para>Working to earn goodwill, and valuing it as an asset predictive of
future market gains, is hardly novel either.  What's interesting is
the extremely high valuation that the behavior of these firms suggests
they put on that goodwill.  They're demonstrably willing to hire
expensive talent for projects that are not direct revenue generators
even during the most capital-hungry phases of the runup to IPO.  And,
at least so far, the market has richly rewarded this behavior.</para>

<para>The principals of these companies themselves are quite clear
about the reasons why goodwill is especially valuable to them.  They
rely heavily on volunteers among their customer base both for product
development and as an informal marketing arm.  Their relationship with
their customer base is intimate, often relying on personal trust bonds
between individuals within and outside the firm.  They do not merely
use the hacker community; they identify with it.</para>

<para>These observations reinforce a lesson we learned earlier from a
different line of reasoning.  The intimate relationship between Red
Hat/VA/O'Reilly and their customers/developers is not one typical of
manufacturing firms.  Rather, it carries to an interesting extreme the
patterns characteristic of highly professionalized and
knowledge-intensive service industries.  Looking outside the
technology industry, we can see these patterns in (for example) law
firms, medical practices, and universities.</para>

<para>We may observe, in fact, that open-source firms hire star
hackers for much the same reasons that universities hire star
academics.  In both cases, the practice is similar in mechanism and
effect to the system of aristocratic patronage that funded most fine
art until after the Industrial Revolution&mdash;a similarity of which
some parties are fully aware.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Getting There From Here</title>

<para>The market mechanisms for funding (and making a profit from!)
open-source development are still evolving rapidly.  The business
models we've reviewed in this essay probably will not be the last to
be invented.  Investors are still thinking through the consequences of
reinventing the software industry as one with an explicit focus on
service rather than closed intellectual property, and will be for some
time to come.</para>

<para>This conceptual revolution will have some cost in foregone profits for
people investing in the sale-value 5% of the industry; historically,
service businesses are not as lucrative as manufacturing businesses
(though as any doctor or lawyer could tell you, the return to the
actual practitioners is often higher).  Any foregone profits,
however, will be more than matched by benefits on the cost side, as
software consumers reap tremendous savings and efficiencies from
open-source products.  (There's a parallel here to the effects that
the displacement of the traditional voice-telephone network by the
Internet is having everywhere).</para>

<para>The promise of these savings and efficiencies is creating a
market opportunity that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are now
moving in to exploit.  As the first draft of this essay was in
preparation, Silicon Valley's most prestigious venture-capital firm
took a lead stake in the first startup company to specialize in 24/7
Linux technical support (Linuxcare).  In August 1999 Red Hat's IPO was
(despite a background slump in Internet and technology stocks) wildly
successful.  It is generally expected that several Linux- and
open-source&ndash;related IPOs will be floated before the end of 1999
&mdash;and that they too will be quite successful. (Year 2000 update: they
were!)</para>

<para>Another very interesting development is the beginnings of systematic
attempts to make task markets in open-source development projects.  <ulink
url="http://www.sourcexchange.com/process.html">SourceXchange</ulink>
and <ulink url="http://www.cosource.com/">CoSource</ulink> represent
slightly different ways of trying to apply a reverse-auction model to
funding open-source development.</para>

<para>The overall trends are clear.  We mentioned before IDC's projection
that Linux will grow faster than all other operating systems
<emphasis>combined</emphasis> through 2003.  Apache is at 61% market share and
rising steadily.  Internet usage is exploding, and surveys such as the
<ulink url="http://leb.net/hzo/ioscount/">Internet Operating System Counter</ulink> show that Linux and other
open-source operating systems are already a plurality on Internet
hosts and steadily gaining share against closed systems.  The need to
exploit open-source Internet infrastructure increasingly conditions
not merely the design of other software but the business practices and
software use/purchase patterns of every corporation there is.  These
trends, if anything, seem likely to accelerate.</para>

<sect1><title>Conclusion: Life after the Revolution</title>

<para>What will the world of software look like once the open-source
transition is complete?</para>

<para>Some programmers worry that the transition to open source will abolish
or devalue their jobs.  The standard nightmare is what I call the
``Open Source Doomsday'' scenario. This starts with the market value
of software going to zero because of all the free source code out
there. Use value alone doesn't attract enough consumers to support
software development. The commercial software industry
collapses. Programmers starve or leave the field. Doomsday arrives
when the open-source culture itself (dependent on the spare time of
all these pros) collapses, leaving nobody around who can program
competently. All die. Oh, the embarrassment!</para>

<para>We have already observed a number of sufficient reasons this won't
happen, starting with the fact that most developers' salaries don't
depend on software sale value in the first place. But the very best
one, worth emphasizing here, is this: when did you last see a software
development group that didn't have way more than enough
work waiting for it?  In a swiftly changing world, in a rapidly 
complexifying and information-centered economy, there will always
be plenty of work and a healthy demand for people who can make
computers do things&mdash;no matter how much time and how many
secrets they give away.</para>

<para>For purposes of examining the software market itself, it will be
helpful to sort kinds of software by how completely the service they
offer is describable by open technical standards, which is well
correlated with how commoditized the underlying service has
become.</para>

<para>This axis corresponds reasonably well to what people are normally
thinking when they speak of `applications' (not at all commoditized,
weak or nonexistent open technical standards), `infrastructure'
(commoditized services, strong standards), and `middleware' (partially
commoditized, effective but incomplete technical standards).  The
paradigm cases today in 2000 would be a word processor (application),
a TCP/IP stack (infrastructure), and a database engine (middleware).</para>

<para>The payoff analysis we did earlier suggests that infrastructure,
applications, and middleware will be transformed in different ways and
exhibit different equilibrium mixes of open and closed source.  It
also suggested the prevalence of open source in a particular software
area would be a function of whether substantial network effects
operate there, what the costs of failure are, and to what extent the
software is a business-critical capital good.</para>

<para>We can venture some predictions if we apply these heuristics not to
individual products but to entire segments of the software market.
Here we go:</para>

<para>Infrastructure (the Internet, the Web, operating systems, and the
lower levels of communications software that has to cross boundaries
between competing parties) will be almost all open source,
cooperatively maintained by user consortia and by for-profit
distribution/service outfits with a role like that of Red Hat today.</para>

<para>Applications, on the other hand, will have the most tendency to remain
closed.  There will be circumstances under which the use value of an
undisclosed algorithm or technology will be high enough (and the costs
associated with unreliability will be low enough, and the risks
associated with a supplier monopoly sufficiently tolerable) that
consumers will continue to pay for closed software.  This is likeliest
to remain true in standalone vertical-market applications where
network effects are weak.  Our lumber-mill example earlier is one
such; biometric identification software seems likeliest, of 1999's hot
prospects, to be another.</para>

<para>Middleware (like databases, development tools, or the customized top
ends of application protocol stacks) will be more mixed.  Whether
middleware categories tend to go closed or open seems likely to depend
on the cost of failures, with higher cost creating market pressure for
more openness.</para>

<para>To complete the picture, however, we need to notice that neither
`applications' nor `middleware' are really stable categories.  Earlier
we saw that individual software technologies seem to go through a
natural life cycle from rationally closed to rationally open.  The
same logic applies in the large.</para>

<para>Applications tend to fall into middleware as standardized
techniques develop and portions of the service are commoditized.
(Databases, for example, became middleware after SQL decoupled front
ends from engines.)  As middleware services are commoditized, they
will in turn tend to fall into the open-source infrastructure&mdash;a
transition we're seeing in operating systems right now.</para>

<para>In a future that includes competition from open source, we can expect
that the eventual destiny of any software technology will be to either
die or become part of the open infrastructure itself.  While this is
hardly happy news for entrepreneurs who would like to collect rent on
closed software forever, it does suggest that the software industry as
a whole will <emphasis>remain</emphasis> entrepreneurial, with new niches
constantly opening up at the upper (application) end and a limited
lifespan for closed-IP monopolies as their product categories fall
into infrastructure.</para>

<para>Finally, of course, this equilibrium will be great for the
software consumers who are driving the process.  More and more
high-quality software will become permanently available to use and
build on instead of being discontinued or locked in somebody's vault.
Ceridwen's magic cauldron is, finally, too weak a
metaphor&mdash;because food is consumed or decays, whereas software
sources potentially last forever. The free market, in its widest
libertarian sense including <emphasis>all</emphasis> un-coerced
activity whether trade or gift, can produce perpetually increasing
software wealth for everyone.</para>

<title>Afterword: Why Closing a Driver Loses Its Vendor Money</title>

<para>Manufacturers of peripheral hardware (Ethernet cards, disk
controllers, video boards and the like) have historically been
reluctant to open up.  This is changing now, with players like Adaptec
and Cyclades beginning to routinely disclose specifications and driver
source code for their boards.  Nevertheless, there is still resistance
out there.  In this appendix I attempt to dispel several of the
economic misconceptions that sustain it.</para>

<para>If you are a hardware vendor, you may fear that open-sourcing
may reveal important things about how your hardware operates that
competitors could copy, thus gaining an unfair competitive advantage.
Back in the days of three- to five-year product cycles this was a
valid argument.  Today, the time your competitors' engineers would
need to spend copying and understanding the copy is a damagingly large
portion of the product cycle, time they are <emphasis>not</emphasis>
spending innovating or differentiating their own product.</para>

<para>This is not a new insight.  Former KGB chief Oleg Kalugin <ulink
url="http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/experience/spies/interviews/kalugin/">
puts the case well</ulink>:</para>

<blockquote><para>
For instance, when we stole IBMs in our blueprints, or some other
electronic areas which the West made great strides in and we were
behind, it would take years to implement the results of our
intelligence efforts. By that time, in five or seven years, the West
would go forward, and we would have to steal again and again, and we'd
fall behind more and more.
</para></blockquote>

<para>But Rudyard Kipling put it better in his poem 
<ulink url="http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/Rudyard_Kipling/kipling_the_mary_gloster.htm">The Mary Gloster</ulink>,
nearly a century ago. He wrote:</para>

<literallayout>
And they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text, 
``You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!''
They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,
And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.
</literallayout>

<para>Acceleration to Internet time makes this effect bite harder.  If
you're really ahead of the game, plagiarism is a trap you
<emphasis>want</emphasis> your competitors to fall into!</para>

<para>In any case, these details don't stay hidden for long these days.
Hardware drivers are not like operating systems or applications;
they're small, easy to disassemble, and easy to clone.  Even teenage
novice programmers can do this&mdash;and frequently do.</para>

<para>There are literally thousands of Linux and FreeBSD programmers
out there with both the capability and the motivation to build drivers
for a new board.  For many classes of device that have relatively
simple interfaces and well-known standards (such as disk controllers
and network cards) these eager hackers can often prototype a driver
almost as rapidly as your own shop could, even without documentation
and without disassembling an existing driver.</para>

<para>Even for tricky devices like video and sound cards, there is not much
you can do to thwart a clever programmer armed with a disassembler.
Costs are low and legal barriers are porous; Linux is an international
effort and there is always a jurisdiction in which reverse-engineering
will be legal.</para>

<para>For hard evidence that all these claims are true, examine the list of
devices supported in the Linux kernel and notice the rate at which new
ones are added to the kernel even without vendor support.</para>

<para>Another good reason to open your drivers is so that you can
<emphasis>concentrate</emphasis> on innovation. Imagine no longer
having to spend your internal staff's time and salaries on rewriting,
testing and distributing new binaries for each new kernel as it comes
out.  You certainly have better things to do with all that skill.</para>

<para>Yet another good reason: nobody wants to wait six months for bug
fixes.  If you have any open-source competition at all, they are
likely to bury you for this reason alone.</para>

<para>Of course, there's the future-proofing effect previously referred
to.  Customers want open source because they know it will extend
the lifetime of the hardware beyond the point that it is
cost-effective for you to support it.</para>

<para>The best reason, though, is because selling hardware is what makes
money for you.  There is no market demand for your secrecy; in fact,
quite the reverse.  If your drivers are hard to find, if they have to
be updated frequently, if they (worst of all) run poorly, it reflects
badly on your hardware and you will sell less of it.  Open source can
solve these problems and boost your revenues.</para>

<para>The message?  Keeping your driver secret looks attractive in the short
run, but is probably bad strategy in the long run (certainly when
you're competing with other vendors that are already open).  But if
you must do it, burn the code into an onboard ROM.  Then publish the
interface to the ROM.  Go open as much as possible to build your
market and demonstrate to potential customers that you believe in your
capacity to out-think and out-innovate competitors where it matters.</para>

<para>If you stay closed you will usually get the worst of all
world&mdash;your secrets will still get exposed, you won't get free
development help, and you won't have wasted your stupider
competition's time on cloning.  Most importantly, you miss an avenue
to widespread early adoption.  A large and influential market (the
people who manage the servers that run effectively all of the Internet
and a plurality of all business data centers) will correctly write
your company off as clueless and defensive because you didn't realize
these things.  Then they'll buy their boards from someone who
did.</para>

The underprovision problem would in fact scale linearly with number of
users if we assumed programming talent to be uniformly distributed in
the project user population as it expands over time.  This is not,
however, the case.</para>

<para>The incentives discussed in <link linkend="HtN">[HtN]</link>
(and some more conventionally economic ones as well) imply that
qualified people tend to seek projects that match their interests, as
well as the projects seeking them. Accordingly, theory suggests (and
experience tends to confirm) that the most valuable (most qualified
and motivated) people tend to discover the projects for which they fit
well relatively early in the projects' life cycles, with a
corresponding fall-off later on.</para>

<para>Hard data are lacking, but on the basis of experience I strongly
suspect the assimilation of talent over a growing project's lifetime
tends to follow a classical logistic curve.</para>

Note for accountants: the argument that service costs will eventually
swamp a fixed up-front price still works if we move from constant
dollars to discounted present value, because future sale revenue
discounts in parallel with future service costs.</para>

<para>A similar but more sophisticated counter to the argument is to
observe that, per-copy, service cost will go to zero when the buyer
stops using the software; therefore you can still win, if the user
stops before he/she has generated too much service cost.  This is
basically just another form of the argument that factory pricing
rewards the production of shelfware.  Perhaps a more instructive way
to put it would be that the risk that your service costs will swamp
the purchase revenue rises with the expected period of usefulness of
the software.  Thus, the factory model penalizes quality.</para>

<para><anchor id="WG"/><emphasis>[WG]</emphasis>
Wayne Gramlich &gt;Wayne@Gramlich.Net&lt; has proposed that the
persistance of the factory model is partly due to antiquated
accounting rules, formulated when machines and buildings were more
important and people less so.  Software company books show the
computers, office furniture, and buildings as assets and the
programmers as expenses.  Or course, in reality, the programmers are
the true assets and the computers, office equipment, and buildings
hardly matter at all.  This perverse valuation is sustained by IRS and
stockmarket pressure for stable and uniform accounting rules that
reduce the complexity of assigning a dollar figure to the company's
value.  The resulting drag has prevented the rules from keeping up
with reality.</para>

<para>On this view, pinning a high price to the bits in the product
(independent of future service value) is partly a sort of defense
mechanism, a way of agreeing for all parties involved to pretend that
the ontological ground hasn't fallen out from under the standard
accounting rules.</para>

<para>(Gramlich also points out that these rules underpin the bizarre and
often self-destructive acquisition sprees that many software companies
tear off on after IPO.  ``Usually the software company issues some
additional stock to build up a war chest.  But they can't spend any of
this money to beef up their programming staff, because the accounting
rules would show that as increased expenses.  Instead, the newly
public software company has to grow by acquiring other software
companies, because the accounting rules let you treat the acquisition
as an investment.'')</para>

<para>Several stimulating discussions with David D. Friedman helped me
refine the `inverse commons' model of open-source cooperation.  I am
also indebted to Marshall van Alstyne for pointing out the conceptual
importance of rivalrous information goods.  Ray Ontko of the Indiana
Group supplied helpful criticism.  A good many people in audiences
before whom I gave talks in the year leading up to June 1999 also
helped; if you're one of those, you know who you are.</para>

<para>It's yet another testimony to the open-source model that this
essay was substantially improved by email feedback I received within
days after initial release.  Lloyd Wood pointed out the importance of
open-source software being `future-proof'. and Doug Dante reminded me
of the `Free the Future' business model.  A question from Adam
Moorhouse led to the discussion of exclusion payoffs.  Lionel Oliviera
Gresse gave me a better name for one of the business models.  Stephen
Turnbull slapped me silly about careless handling of free-rider
effects. Anthony Bailey and Warren Young corrected some facts in the
Doom case study.  Eric W. Sink contributed the insight that the
factory model rewards shelfware.</para>
